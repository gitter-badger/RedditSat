The full specific aspects of the functionality of the payload still needs to be determined but it will be an Atmega 328P AU with an SX1278 LoRa transmitter controlling various Atmega nodes with different pieces of code along with a variety of sensors that will be used by these nodes, sort of a "fly your own code". Any ideas on how to efficiently do this are welcome though the the payload is not the main aspect of the mission.
