Deployable solar panels and a dipole antenna will be used, A combination of Fishing line & springs / hinges will be used along with a resistor or nichrome wire to melt the fishing line and release the mechanism. The deployment of these will be taken care of by both separated systems to ensure redundancy, the main goal will be the deployment of the antenna as the satellite will be able to function properly with reduced capability without deployed cells. Tape measure antenna will be used and will be deployed along with the solar panels using a timer and a switch to ensure proper deployment and end deployment sequence.
