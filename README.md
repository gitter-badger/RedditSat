An Atmega 328P AU powered pocketqube satellite focused on education and research, simplicity is a main focus. The craft will transmit a LoRa signal which can be heard using simple and cheap hardware. It will hopefully be the first 1P satellite to have deployable solar cells and a LoRa transmitter. More specific info on each system can be read in each section. No actual files have been uploaded due most of them being on my main PC while I am on holiday.

Any ideas & contributions are deeply apreciatted.
