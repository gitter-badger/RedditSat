# Atto-Sat
An Atmega 328P AU powered pocketqube satellite focused on education and research, simplicity is a main focus. The craft will transmit a LoRa signal which can be heard using simple and cheap hardware. More specific info on each system can be read in each section. No actual files have been uploaded due most of them being on my main PC while I am on holiday.

Any ideas & contributions are deeply apreciatted.
