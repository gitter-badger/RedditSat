Any ideas & contributions are deeply apreciatted.
## Software
This plans to be in space, where it cannot be maintained. For that reason, the number one software priority is software. To help with this, keep the following in mind:

### Use OTBS
This project uses OTBS style (K&R style but with braces whenever possible). This helps ensure code clarity and avoid mistakes that come from ambiguity.

### Use The JPL Institutional Coding Standard
The JPL created a coding standard with IEEE and NASA that you can read here. This standard makes sure that any code being produced will be as robust as possible. Please don't be intimidated by it, just keep the Power of Ten in mind and we'll ask you to correct a merge request if necessary.

## Hardware
Please use KiCad or a file format that can be interpreted by KiCad. This makes sure that anyone can access and modify the hardware in this project without needing access to proprietary software.
